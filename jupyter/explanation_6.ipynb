    "# Explanation for problem 6: Union & Intersection of Two Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "There were no requirements for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union\n",
    "I go through all items in both linked lists and put them into a set. That way I keep only unique items from both lists. I then iterate through all items in the set to create a new linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intersection\n",
    "If any of the two linked lists are empty, I can simply return an empty linked list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, I put the items from each linked list into a separate set. That way, I remove all duplicate values. By using `sorted()` on the sets, I receive automatically lists where the values are sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "I go then through both lists at the same time, adding values that exist in both lists to my new linked list, and skipping over values that are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency\n",
    "Assumption: \n",
    "* `N1` is the number of elements in the first linked list.\n",
    "* `N2` is the number of elements in the second linked list.\n",
    "* `N = N1+N2` is the total number of elements in both lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Union\n",
    "I loop through both linked lists once: `O(N1) + O(N2)`, and then once more through the set of all elements to create a new linked list, which is worst case `O(N)`. The total time efficiency is therefore `O(N)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intersection\n",
    "I loop through both linked lists to retrieve all elements: `O(N1) + O(N2)`. I then sort both sets into lists, which costs in the worst case `O(N1*log(N1)) + O(N2*log(N2))`. I then loop through each list once to create a new linked list, which again costs `O(N1) + O(N2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total time necessary for the intersection is therefore `O(N1*log(N1)) + O(N2*log(N2))`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Union\n",
    "I use a set to collect all items in both lists, which needs in the worst case `O(N)` space. I then create a new linked list of the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space requirement for the union is therefore `O(N)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intersection\n",
    "For the intersection, I create two sets for the items in each linked list, which requires `O(N1) + O(N2)` space. I reuse that space for the sorted lists. The `sorted` algorithm may require temporarily additional space of size `O(N1) + O(N2)`. I then create a new linked list that requires also `O(N1) + O(N2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total space requirement for the intersection is therefore `O(N)`."
